# Sudoku_solver
 This is a sudoku solver which solves a given sudoku problem 
 
 This solver was created by me as my project work for second semester of my first year.
 This solver uses python functions from library like date and json.
 It solves a given 9*9 sudoku and stores the solved problem in a file named "record.txt".
